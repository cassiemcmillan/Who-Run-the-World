# Who-Run-the-World

2012-2020 R&B/hip hop collaboration network data from the primary analyses of McMillan 2022. An edgelist of symmetric, binary collborative ties from 2012-2020 is available in collaboration_edgelist_2012_2020.csv.

Actor-level characteristics are presented in artists_2012_2020.csv. Gender is coded as 1 = Woman, 0 = Man. Artists are also characterized by whether or not they won a Grammy award during the period of interest (GrammyWinner = 1), or if they were nominated for a Grammy, but did not win the award (GrammyNominee = 1). YearStarted indicated the year that the artist became active in the music industry.
